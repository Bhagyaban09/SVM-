# Iris SVM Classification

This project aims to classify the species of iris flowers from the famous Iris dataset using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The Iris dataset, introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936, has become a standard example in pattern recognition and machine learning. It consists of 150 instances of iris flowers, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a multivariate dataset that contains three classes of iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each class has 50 instances, with the following features:

- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is loaded, converted to a pandas DataFrame, and checked for missing values. Feature scaling is performed using StandardScaler from scikit-learn to ensure optimal performance of the SVM algorithm.

2. **Data Exploration**: Visualizations such as pair plots, histograms, and correlation matrices are created to analyze feature distributions, relationships, and correlations.

3. **Model Training**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets. SVM classifiers are trained using three different kernels: linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF).

4. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the trained models is evaluated using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. K-fold cross-validation (with K=5) is employed to provide a robust estimate of the model's generalization ability.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the `iris_svm.py` script to execute the code.
4. The script will output the performance metrics for each kernel type and the cross-validation scores.

## Findings

The key findings from the project are:

- The SVM models achieved high accuracy rates, typically around 90-95% across different kernels, with the RBF kernel generally performing the best.
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler improved model convergence and distance metric accuracy.
- Visualizations provided insights into feature relationships, distributions, and correlations, aiding in understanding the dataset's patterns.
- Cross-validation affirmed the model's robustness and generalization ability.

## Future Work

- Explore additional hyperparameter tuning, such as adjusting the regularization parameter C and polynomial degree.
- Experiment with different feature engineering techniques to potentially improve model performance.
- Extend the analysis to other classification algorithms and compare their performance with SVMs.
